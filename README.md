Jalousie
========

A library providing expandable layouts and views for Android. Currently, Jalousie has only one extension of `LinearLayout`, which works in horizontal and vertical direction. 
More expandable views will be added soon. 

You can find some implementations in the samples project [`Jalousie Samples`][1].


Usage
